# RouteRover

RouteRover is a web application that helps visualize the shortest path between a start node and a target node, considering user-generated wall nodes. Users can choose between various pathfinding algorithms, adjust the speed of the visualization, set the pixel size of each node, and generate random mazes.

## Features

- **Algorithms**: Select between BFS, Dijkstra, Greedy Best First Search, and A*.
- **Speed Control**: Choose the speed of the visualization (Slow, Normal, Fast).
- **Node Customization**: Adjust the pixel size of each node.
- **Random Maze Generation**: Generate random mazes between the source and target nodes.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**
- **CSS**
- **JavaScript**

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    [git clone https://github.com/coderanger1826/Path-Finder-Visualizer.git](https://github.com/coderanger1826/RouteRover.git)
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd RouteRover
    ```

## Usage

1. Open `index.html` in your browser.
2. Select the start node and the target node by clicking on the grid.
3. Add walls by clicking on the nodes you want to block.
4. Choose an algorithm from the dropdown menu.
5. Set the speed of the visualization: Slow, Normal, or Fast.
6. Adjust the pixel size of each node using the provided options.
7. (Optional) Generate a random maze using the random maze generation feature.
8. Click on the "Visualize" button to see the pathfinding algorithm in action.
